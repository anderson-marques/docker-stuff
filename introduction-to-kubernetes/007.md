# From Borg to Kubernetes

According to the abstract of Google's [Borg paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html), published in 2015,

## _"Google's Borg system is a cluster manager that runs hundreds of thousands of jobs, from many thousands of different applications, across a number of clusters each with up to tens of thousands of machines."_

For more than a decade, Borg was Google's secret to run containerized workloads in production. Whatever services we use from Google, like Gmail, Drive, etc., they are all serviced using Borg.

Some of the initial authors of Kubernetes were Google employees who have used Borg and developed it in the past. They poured in their valuable knowledge and experience while designing Kubernetes. Some of the features/objects of Kubernetes that can be traced back to Borg, or to lessons learnt from it, are:

- API Servers
- Pods
- IP-per-Pod
- Services
- Labels
