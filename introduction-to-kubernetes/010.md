The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is one of the projects hosted by The Linux Foundation. CNCF aims to accelerate the adoption of containers, microservices, and cloud-native applications.

CNCF hosts a set of projects, with more to be added in the future. CNCF provides resources to each of the projects, but, at the same time, each project continues to operate independently under its pre-existing governance structure and with its existing maintainers. Currently, the following projects are part of CNCF:

- containerd for Container Runtime
- rkt for Container Runtime
- Kubernetes for Container Orchestration
- Linkerd for Service Mesh
- gRPC for Remote Procedure Call
- Container Network Interface (CNI) for Container Networking
- CoreDNS for Service Discovery
- Prometheus for Monitoring
- OpenTracing for Tracing
- Fluentd for Logging.

As we can see, the current set of CNCF projects can cover the entire lifecycle of an application, from its execution using container runtimes, to its monitoring and logging. This is very important to meet the CNCF goal.
