# What Is **Container Orchestration**

In Development and Quality Assurance (QA) environments, we can get away with running containers on a single host to develop and test applications. However, when we go to production, we do not have the same liberty, as we need to ensure that our applications:

- Are fault-tolerant
- Can scale, and do this on-demand
- Use resources optimally
- Can discover other applications automatically, and communicate with each other
- Are accessible from the external world 
- Can update/rollback without any downtime. 

Container Orchestrators are the tools which group hosts together to form a cluster, and help us fulfill the requirements mentioned above.
