# **Why Use** Kubernetes

Kubernetes is very portable and extensible. Kubernetes can be deployed on VMs, bare-metal, or public/private/hybrid/multi-cloud setups. Also, Kubernetes has a very modular and pluggable architecture. We can write custom APIs or plugins to extend its functionalities.

For a successful open source project, the community is as important as having great code. Kubernetes has a very thriving community across the world. It has more than 1350 contributors, who, over time, have done over 47,000 commits. There are meet-up groups in different cities which meet regularly to discuss about Kubernetes and its ecosystem. There are Special Interest Groups (SIGs), which focus on special interests, such as scaling, bare-metal, networking, etc.
