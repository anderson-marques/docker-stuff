# **Where** to Deploy Container Orchestrators

Most Container Orchestrators can be deployed on the infrastructure of our choice. We can deploy them on bare-metal, VMs, on-premise, or on a cloud of our choice. For example, Kubernetes can be deployed on our laptop/workstation, inside a company's datacenter, on AWS, on OpenStack, etc. There are even one-click installers available to setup Kubernetes on the Cloud, like Google Container Engine on Google Cloud, or Azure Container Service on Microsoft Azure. Similar solutions are available for other Container Orchestrators, as well.

There are companies who offer managed Container Orchestration as a Service.
